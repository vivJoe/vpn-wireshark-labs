UDP Packet Capture Explanation (Wireshark + VPN)

This file contains a brief explanation of the UDP packet capture performed during a VPN session using ProtonVPN (WireGuard protocol).

What was done:
1. A VPN connection was established using ProtonVPN with the WireGuard protocol.
2. Wireshark was used to monitor network traffic.
3. A filter was applied to view only UDP packets using the filter expression:
4. Screenshots were taken during the VPN session, and packets were analyzed.

What was observed:
- The VPN client communicated with a remote IP address (e.g., 37.19.221.196) using **UDP port 51820** â€” the default port used by WireGuard.
- Wireshark showed packets such as:
- Handshake Initiation
- Transport Data
- Keep alive Messages

These are part of the encrypted VPN tunnel, showing how secure communication occurs between the client and the VPN gateway.

Why UDP?
WireGuard and many VPNs use UDP because:
- It's faster than TCP (no handshakes or retransmissions).
- It's better for real-time communication like video, VoIP, and VPN tunnels.
- It allows custom handling of packet loss or encryption.

Summary:
This UDP capture demonstrates how VPNs transmit encrypted traffic using UDP. The packets captured prove that the VPN was actively exchanging data with its gateway using the WireGuard protocol.
